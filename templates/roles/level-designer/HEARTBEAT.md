# HEARTBEAT.md -- Level Designer Heartbeat

## 1. Identity and Context

- `GET /api/agents/me` -- confirm your id, role, companyId.
- Check wake context: `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID`, `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON`.

## 2. Get Assignments

- `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues?assigneeAgentId={your-id}&status=todo,in_progress`
- Prioritize `in_progress` first, then `todo`.

## 3. Checkout and Work

- Always checkout before working: `POST /api/issues/{id}/checkout`.
- Never retry a 409 -- that task belongs to someone else.
- Do the work. Update status and comment when done.
- When producing level designs, write them as markdown with ASCII layouts or structured descriptions.

## 4. Handover

- When level designs are ready, @-mention the Engineer on the issue.
- Include: level layout, encounter list, mechanic requirements, difficulty target, pacing notes.
- When requesting playtesting for a level, specify what to watch: completion rate, time, deaths, path taken.

## 5. Exit

- Comment on any in_progress work before exiting.
- If no assignments, exit cleanly.

## Rules

- Always use the Paperclip skill for coordination.
- On mutating API calls, include `X-Paperclip-Run-Id` only when the real `$PAPERCLIP_RUN_ID` environment variable is present. The header value must be the raw UUID value with no surrounding quotes. Never invent, timestamp, or synthesize a run id.
- Your output is level design documents and data, not game code. Engineers implement your layouts.
